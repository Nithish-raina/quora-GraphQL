## 🗂️ Project structure

```
	Follow a *feature-oriented* structure for a clean and scalable codebase.
```

📌 **Why feature-oriented?**

- It's aligned with **Domain-Driven Design** (DDD) principles.
- Avoids scattering logic across multiple unrelated folders – a common issue in **layer-oriented** structures.
